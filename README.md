##A weather application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows users to check the current weather conditions of any city in real time. This type of application uses a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch live data from the internet based on the user's input. The front end of the application is designed using HTML to create the structure, including an input field where users can type the name of a city, and a button that triggers the search. CSS is used to enhance the appearance of the application by adding background images, styling the input and buttons, and making the layout visually appealing and user-friendly. JavaScript brings interactivity to the app. When a user enters a city name and clicks the "Get Weather" button, JavaScript captures that input and sends a request to the weather API. The API responds with current weather data, such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions (like sunny, rainy, or cloudy). JavaScript then extracts the relevant data from the response and dynamically displays it on the webpage, giving users immediate feedback without needing to reload the page.
